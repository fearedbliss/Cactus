## Summary

- Name: **Disotheb**
- Author(s): **erevos**
- Version: **Hotfix 4**
- Year Released: **2023**
- Porter: **fearedbliss**
- Maintainer: **fearedbliss**
- Port hosted and verified internally by **fearedbliss**
- [**Download Now**](https://xyinn.org/diablo/platforms/gold/Disotheb_Hotfix_4/)

## Includes

- Cactus Platform (1.10)
- Disotheb (Full Version)
- Disotheb (Hotfix 4)

## Installation

- Extract the platform into your **`Platforms`** Directory.
- Add an entry to Cactus called **`Disotheb (Hotfix 4)`** that launches
  **`Game.exe`** with the flags set to **`-3dfx`**.

## Known Issues

- The game will not work with **`cnc-ddraw`** and will crash (and/or also have
  messed up UI). It requires the use of the provided **`glide3x.dll`**.
- There is an [open bug](https://github.com/bolrog/d2dx/issues/124) with **`D2DX`**
  where screenshots cannot be taken from the game. You'll need to rely on the
  screenshot captured by Windows (and some image editing) for your screenshots.
- When playing in window mode, opening and closing UI elements will cause the
  mouse to jump outside the window.
- The help menu in game is cut off when playing below resolutions of **`1280x768`**.

Due to the above window/cursor issues, I would recommend playing on **`1280x768`**,
full screen + stretched mode, which is mostly the default, until the situation
improves in a potential future patch. If your game starts at **`1024x768`**,
make sure to adjust.
  
## Notes
  
- If you make a new Witch character and name her **`test`**, she will start at
  level 50. Originally I thought this was a bug but I think I just hit some
  a magic string. Sorry for discovering your secret, erevos :).

## Porting Fixes

This mod is ***VERY*** particulate about its set up and how things are loaded.
If any deviation is done, the game will most likely crash. Also note, that it
seems the order of how you load the dlls in **`D2Mod.ini`** matters. Which
makes sense.

- The mod normally depends on another launcher for its hooking mechanism. I used
  the **`D2ModSetup.bat`** included in **`D2Mod102`** to patch the
  **`D2gfx.dll`** on **`1.10`** so that it loads **`D2Mod.dll`**. Once that was
  done, I rewired the rest of the dlls by:
	- Adding **`PlugY.dll`** to **`D2Mod.ini`** at the end of the dll load list.
	  Order matters.
- Removed the unused **`Utility.dll`** and **`CharStart.dll`** from **`D2Mod.ini`**
  and their corresponding dlls.
- Removed **`dsound.dll`** and **`dsound.ini`**. Cactus already provides
  **DSOAL w/ OpenAL Soft** which implements proper **Environmental Effects**
  support. **IndirectSound** doesn't implement it, it just fakes the feature,
  from the **`dsound.ini`**:

	```
	EAX ("Environmental Audio Extensions") is not emulated by IndirectSound.

	IndirectSound can emulate EAX support, however.
	In other words, IndirectSound will pretend that EAX is supported
	so that games using IndirectSound will think that EAX is available.
	This is useful for some games that don't calculate
	3D positional audio unless EAX is supported.

	(Actual emulation of EAX is under development
	but is not yet ready to release.)
	```
- Fixed main menu mod name by changing **`VersionText`** from 
  **`Escape from the Afterlife`** to **`Disotheb`** in **`PlugY.ini`**.
