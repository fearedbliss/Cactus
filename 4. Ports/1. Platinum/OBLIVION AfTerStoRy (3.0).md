## Installation

- Extract the platform into your **`Platforms`** Directory.
- Add an entry to Cactus called **`OBLIVION AfTerStoRy (3.0)`** that launches
  **`Game.exe`**, with the flags set to **`-direct`**.

## Known Issues

- None

## Porting Fixes

- Removed **PlugY**.
- Replaced the included **`D2gfx.dll`** which already comes patched to load
  **`D2Mod.dll`** and **`PlugY.dll`**, with a fresh copy of **`D2gfx.dll`**.
  Afterwards I used the **`D2ModSetup.bat`** included in **`D2Mod102`** to
  patch it on **`1.10`**, so that it only loads **`D2Mod.dll`**.
- Removed the **`glide3x.dll`**.
- Removed all of the **1 KB** MPQ files that were in the mod. These are
  Protected Files. Furthermore, these files couldn't even open with my MPQ
  editor. I don't believe they are necessary.
