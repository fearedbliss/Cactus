## Patch Notes

```
[25.FEB.2012] MEDIAN XL 2012 v005 IS RELEASED

A relatively small patch that contains some balance changes, bugfixes and a new
druid bow skill to help you across that annoying low level gap until Spore Shot
kicked in.

[07.FEB.2012] SPELAR LITE DOTA

Thanks to the nice people who offered me a Dota2 beta key: Jeemeeh and Abedeus.
Honourable mention goes to David V.

[04.FEB.2012] PLEASE REDOWNLOAD

It is possible that a bug snuck into the v004 release version that made amazon
Fury ineffective. I have no time to verify this claim so I changed its effect
from attack speed to enhanced damage as a quick fix. Redownload v004 if you
downloaded it before this message.

[03.FEB.2012] MEDIAN XL 2012 v004 IS RELEASED

Carebear Stare The previous 2012 releases were aimed at veteran Median XL
players, leading to many complaints from normal humans about the increased
difficulty. This patch reduces the difficulty to the usual level and nerfs
several annoying or overpowered monsters.

Join the Wild Hunt The amazon has received a major overhaul. Spear based
huntress builds now have access to Fury to enhance their abilities, bloodwitches
gain increased survivability and a large number of bonuses for staying low on
health.

Bugfixes Not even Median XL is flawless, but it just got a little closer to
perfection.

In case you were wondering, v003 was not publicly released.

[04.JAN.2012] MEDIAN XL 2012 v002 IS RELEASED

A small bugfix patch for Median XL 2012.

[01.JAN.2012] MEDIAN XL 2012 IS RELEASED

A significant update for Median XL. New monsters, new balance, new skills, new
items!

Eve of Destruction Is the grind getting to you? Median XL 2012 rescales the game
so you reach level 120 at the end of Terror difficulty instead of Destruction.
All Destruction difficulty monsters have the highest monster level and drop
sacred uniques and sets, similar to Inferno difficulty in Diablo III.

Little Mr. Sunshine The morninglord, the holy caster paladin paradigm, has been
revamped with a new mechanic (Resonance) that rewards players for creatively
combining skills.

New monsters From trolls that blink invulnerable to venomous snakes in the
grass, Median XL 2012 adds a large selection of new regular and elite monsters
to fight.

Rolling out the cheese wheel Fighting monsters that are slowed to a standstill
is not a challenge, therefore slow target has been drastically cut down. Freeze
spells on the other hand are much more effective this time round.

Get the patch now on the download page.

[21.DEC.2011] A NEW PATCH IS COMING

The upcoming patch will feature many improvements, including the addition of
many new monsters and the implementation of D3-style 'Inferno' difficulty
(basically a level 121 bonus difficulty) while the regular levelling-up grind is
compressed into two difficulties instead of the boring three difficulties.

Uniques

- You may need to refind Thunder Machine and Athulua's Command: their procs no

Blindside.

Drop rates

- Reduced unique bias of Act bosses to prevent farming runs.
