## Patch Notes

```
Here is some of the documentation for Darkness Weaves. This should alleviate any
questions about the mod (Which seem to be propping up lately)

===========================================

HISTORY

Darkness Weaves began as a
simple “Ironman” mod to Diablo 2. When the Expansion Pack came out (Lord of
Destruction), the move was made to that game type.  Ironman game play stems back
to the days of Battle.net and Diablo I. Players who were tired of the madness of
battlenet (Cheating, Duping, Town Killing, etc) began playing variations of
Diablo. These included games like “Naked Mage” or “Garbage Run”, “Powersweep”
etc… Of these, the “Ironman” version was probably the most popular. It leveled
the playing field for all and made the game MUCH more challenging and fun to
play. It DID require people to be totally honest and fair, and in doing so,
promoted gaming groups, clans, guilds and the like. It was a good time for
Battle.Net and Diablo.  The first few builds of Darkness Weaves were simple
modifications that changed interaction with NPC’s and characters starting
equipment. Later, as the mod progressed, it became evident that players could
not survive long (Especially in Hardcore) without a little help. New items and
item types were added, leveling the playing field. The mod was good, people were
happy. But it still lacked.  When the LOD set came out, it got much better, as
more modding choices were made available by Blizzard. DWX was born and
surprisingly, in the 1.0 version (The NON beta version) there only existed one
bug, and it was a tough one to chase down. (Thanks Chris for finally swatting
that dreaded monster!) DWX2 is a new rebuild of DWX. It is D2:LOD specific only
and a lot of issues were addressed, redressed and tested. In your hands is a
pretty spiffy mod that will challenge your style of gameplay. It’s taken hours
and hours of work to re-write DWX. I hope you enjoy it!

OVERVIEW

The Ironman style of
gameplay is radically different from what you have experienced (unless you have
played IM before). You start with nothing.  You can buy nothing. You can repair
nothing. Everything you use will come from the ‘land’. Weapons, armor, potions,
scrolls etc… Diablo II’s economic system was one that was woefully lacking. This
is remedied by the fact that gold has little to no use in the game. Monsters
won’t drop gold. You may find a random pile here or there. That’s okay. If you
run with a hireling, you can save all that and revive them when they die. Keep
in mind that it will take a LOT of money to revive them and the amount of gold
you find, will never be enough. Keep your Merc alive!  Town Portals are
non-existent. Every time you want to go to town, you will have to hoof it, or
use a waypoint. This will change the way you play the game drastically.
Item/Inventory management skills become a real necessity in DWX2. Your favorite
weapon must be carefully used. Once it is gone, it is gone.  For more specific
advice, go to the GAMEPLAY below.  All in all, IM style makes the game
incredibly challenging. It brings to light some of those skills that maybe you
don’t use much. Prayer, Warmth, Find Potion, etc…
===========================================

CHANGES

Some of the changes from DWX
to DWX2 are: -->All NPC’s are now accessible. You can now complete all quests.
You can drop items off to them, but you will ONLY get 1 GP per item, regardless
of its relative worth. Charsi and others can still repair, but you will NEVER
have enough gold to do it, unless you spend your entire career making town runs
(and with waypoints only, its going to take awhile). If you do that, you
probably shouldn’t be playing an IM mod anyhow.  -->A lot of the mundane items
were dropped. In their place are some new charms and class specific books. I
wont give all the details, since playing it is what the thrill is about.
-->Monsters are now more manageable, but still very tough. Not all monsters
require you to kill them. Sometimes its best to just run away and come back
later (much later).  -->Some of the more annoying monsters (Cave Leapers, Imps)
have been changed, or had their skills modified a bit.  -->There are some new
monsters, as well as some of the old favorites. Bandits and Elementals all make
their return. Plus a few new surprises.  -->There are hordes of new cube
recipes. Hints to these are scattered (in a pretty vague fashion) across your
game load screens. Pay attention and see if you can decipher them.  -->Skills
received some tweaks from the previous version. Nothing radical, but just some
fine-tuning.  -->The EXP tables got a revisit. The 250 level cap is gone,
replaced with the 99 level cap. I hated to do this, but I found that characters
were scaling up far too fast and wound up walking over Baal at around level 50.
Then in nightmare mode, they only earned paltry experience. Not a problem until
you realize that on that track, they would end NM mode at about level 90-110.
Then when proceeding to Hell mode, the problem would be intensified greatly.
That and the fact that Monster’s begin behaving REALLY badly after their level
goes above 99. So out with the new, in with the old. The 250 level Experience
Table is great, but not within the scope of this mod.

===========================================

GAMEPLAY

This section will deal with
some specific game-play techniques that are intricate to playing IM style. You
obviously will develop your own style of playing, but if you are new to this
mod, or seem to be stuck, read on for a little Designer Insight.  -->RUN! Almost
every problem in DWX2 can be handled by running. The only time you will find
yourself in serious trouble is when a boss ambushes you with “Holy Freeze” as an
Aura, or come up against a pack with of monsters who are ‘Fast’. When in doubt,
put distance between you and that pack of monsters. Let them come to you one or
two at a time and deal with them. There is no shame in FALLING BACK.  -->Pick up
everything. You have an increased backpack. Your stash is larger. If you think
you can use it, put it into your pack. Stash it when you get to town. You will
need it later, trust me. You will often find yourself running with tons of
potions. This is completely normal. Don’t be embarrassed.  -->As much fun as
those tiny little charms are, they become a burden when you realize that all of
those bonuses don’t really make up for your lack of space in your inventory. Use
them, get rid of them, see what they do in your cube.  -->Watch your inventory!
Nothing will give you more grief than to have that nice set of armor beat
completely off your body by high damage HTH monsters. Keep a set or two in your
backpack and when necessary, change it out to reflect the situation. The same
goes with weapons. You will undoubtedly find a nice weapon that can inflict
massive damage. You will cry when you watch it break because you didn’t use it
conservatively. Use regular/magic weapons for standard monster bashing. Use your
Uber-Gear when you are about to fight the big boss and his minions. You have two
weapons slots, use them. (Amazons get off easy here, as do Sorc’s.) -->Protect
your hireling. If you like to use them, get used to helping them. If you thought
you carried lots of potions before, wait till you have to nursemaid them around!
And because once dead, they are almost impossible to hire (especially in later
acts when they are high level), it is in your (and their) best interest to keep
them alive. Remember, you cannot Town-Portal to pull them out of a dangerous
situation. If they are in trouble, you had better wade in and rescue them, or
hope they weren’t carrying good gear when they go down.  -->Skills. You will
come to appreciate the under used skills. Think of new and interesting ways to
employ them. Nothing makes a DWX2 party happier than a Paladin with High Level
Prayer.  -->Stats. No matter what your class, Vitality becomes very important.
Not only for the life, but for the Stamina as well. Enough said.  -->Gems. You
will develop your own opinion about them. Save them for higher gems? Or use them
and lose them? The choice is yours. Glyphs help offset the pain of this
decision.  -->Keep your waypoints in mind. Know where the last one was. If you
have to fall back and dash up to town, you are going to have to go down the
previous WP and work your way back. Suicide is best accomplished by going back
down that portal you just hauled your sorry butt to town with, because nobody
likes Physically Immune, Holy Freeze, Extra Fast monsters. NOBODY.  -->When
playing in MultiPlayer, make sure you can work as a team. This cannot be
stressed enough. It’s pretty sad to see two or three people arguing over a
regular, non-magical Claymore in Act I.  -->Even though your Assassin is best
when Clawing monsters to death, there might be a time when that Rare Bow you
just found can be very effective. Don’t be afraid to try weapons that aren’t the
‘norm’ for your class. Eagle Orbs have low durability, and losing a real nice
one because you weren’t paying attention serves you right!  -->Be careful when
using the ‘Players X’ command. Although it is tempting, you will regret it when
you spawn a horrendous pack of GoreBelly’s and cannot get through them because
their HP’s last longer than your weapons and armor.  -->Hardcore. The ultimate
way to play IM. Become the master of falling back and potion/item management
skills increase tenfold in importance. Be conservative. Especially after you
have clawed your way up a few levels.  -->When it comes to inventory management,
you should be thinking two or three items ahead. That spiffy gemmed up Crystal
Sword is on its last leg and you are about to enter an area that is notorious
for no spawning good items. Better go back and work an area for some spares.
