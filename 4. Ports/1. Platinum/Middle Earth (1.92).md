## Patch Notes

```
Changes in Version 1.92 (LoD):

Runes can be downgraded in the cube (put a rune in the cube and transmute it to
the next lower rune)

Added runewords for four, five and six of the same rune in one item (amplifying
the power of the runes)

Added runewords: three word runewords can be enhanced with an additional rune to
make them slightly more powerful (see cubes’n’runes info)

The three hell-like extra levels in act 5 are now populated by EXTREME amounts
of highlevel monsters and bosses/champions. They are meant to be bonus levels if
you feel fit to take on the challenge. If you just entered act 5 you WILL NOT be
able to survive in there!

Succubi type monsters less frequent

Orcs less frequent

Reduces number of different spawnable monstertypes to 3 per area (with few
exceptions)

Magiclevel of wands, staffs, scepters and orbs increase slightly with itemlevel,
giving higher level rods a better chance to drop with higher level affixes
(should make it more probable to get a good magic runestaff than shortstaff)

Many ranged attack monsters (like Spikefiends and Skeleton Archers) made buggy
and too much damage – that was fixed

Bossgroups in Morgoth’s Throneroom toned down slightly

Kickdamage for boots added (was accidentally set to 0 all the time)

Added three unique throwing weapons

Added affixes on melee weapons that have %chance to cast a spell on successful
hit (Chainlightning, Blizzard and Meteor at different skilllevels)

Added affixes on body armor that have %chance to casts spells on getting hit and
on dying (get one for your weak hireling :) 

Dark Elf trap skills tweaked (some were underpowered and some were vastly
overpowered like Blade Sentinel and Blade Fury)

Amazon classspecific spears are now faster than normal spears

Increased poison damage of gems

Affixes for rings, amulets, charms and jewels tweaked to make lowlevel affixes
less frequent in higher levels

Reduced range of ressurection for Orc Shamans and Unravelers

======================

Changes in Version 1.91 (LoD):

Reduced monsterdensity a bit

Added resistance description to monsters. Monsters that are marked "resistant
to" have over or around 50% resistance to the given element or 33% and more
resistance to magical or physical damage. Resistance to all elements means to
Fire, Cold, Lightning and Poison. Magical and Physical resistance is given as
resistance to magic and resistance to physical (Bonespirit for example is
magical damage) So if a monster has descriptive text saying "Animal - resists
fire + physical" it means this monster is class Animal (for weapons dealing
special damage to Animals) and has over 50% fire resistance and over 33%
physical resistance.  The values are taken from an average of all three
difficulty levels, so a monster marked as resistant to fire might have only 30%
fire resistance in Eldar diff but in later diffs it will have much more giving
it an average of over 50%.

A bug in the diversity of monsters that allowed up to 25 different monstertypes
to appear in one are was fixed. Now only 3-4 different monstertypes spawn in any
single area.

Ranged attack monters had buggy tohit and hit way more often than intended. They
should now have a reasonable chance to hit.

Added some new affixes (+to single skills on rings and amulets, onhit skills on
weapons and ongettinghit skills on Torso armor)

Switched the Illusion skill of the Sorceress from Enchant to Chilling Armor

Fixed buggy damage of Charged Strike and improved Rohirrim Poison skills

Fixed bug with the Tittasil quest in act 3

Full sets now grant a glowing effect to the character and some light radius

Added %damage vs Trolls, Orcs, Greater demons etc to some uniques (you must find
these in version 1.91) 

Removed Scatha the Worm from Morgoth's Inner Sanctum since an extra fast Dragon
could bring players in no-win situations. Also removed magic resistance from The
Sould Eater of Nan-Dungortheb.

Unsocket recipe now requires one unique item to work (socketed item + unique
item => unsocketed item plus socket fillers)

======================

Changes in Version 1.9 (LoD): (this version is needed for Blizzard's Patch 1.10)

Many unique items quality enhanced, some of them greatly

Unique items and runes drop more often

Most Runewords and crafting recipes are now easier to create (see
CubesnRunes.rtf)

Monsters in Maiar and Valar difficulty have a 20% chance to have one or more of
the following: Faster walk Faster attack Faster cast Slightly increased
elemental resistance Slightly increased physical resistance Slightly increased
hitpoints 

Monsters in later difficulties make increasingly less pauses between attacks

higher level exceptional and elite items normally can have more. The maximum
possible sockets are now INDEPENDANT from difficulty or playerlevel.

Whirlwind has a casting delay of 1,5 seconds now (being constantly in whirlwind
mode makes you nearly invincible since you leech life all the time and
automatically evade most projectile attacks by being a moving target)

Casting Delay removed from Chain Lightning

Casting Delay removed from Blizzard and added to Frozen Orb

Set items now spawn with a socket (if that item can have a socket) and Full Set
Bonus increased considerably

prefixes such as King’s or Merciless

under the monstername): Humans, Animals, Orcs, Trolls and Greater Demons.
Greater Demons include Dragons, Balrogs, Nazgul and all act end bosses

Shout duration greatly increased

Impale now uses normal attack (that means it's much faster) it adds 300% damage
at level 20 and no tohit bonus or other effect

Decoy duration increased and enabled 3 decoys at one time

Valkyrie actually deals reasonable damage (1.10 Blizzard change)

“Of the Maiar”, “of the Valar” etc. affix series now adds to all four stats

Affixes for jewels and charms overhauled. Many of the existing affixes had
unbalanced levels or were otherwise badly designed (like having a +1 max damage
affix of level 1 and the next in the series was a +3 max damage affix of level
89...)

Sauron Reborn's Lightning Bolt of Death can knockback

Bows and crossbows only require dexterity now

Spearclass weapons require less strength

Two handed swords require less dexterity

Items in the gamble list include now all but the most powerful normal and
exceptional items (no elite items)

Crossbows are now only slightly slower than Bows

Class specific bows increased in speed

increased - were it formerly 3-5 it is now 2-6 for example)

Elite items have a bonus of +6 to their possible magical properties

Elite Weapons have been added built-in deadly strike, slightly faster cast and
slightly faster swing

Resist Fire / Lightning / Cold auras add upto 20% max resist in their respective
element
