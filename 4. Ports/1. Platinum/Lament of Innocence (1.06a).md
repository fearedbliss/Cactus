## Includes

- Cactus Platform (1.10)
- Lament of Innocence (1.06a)

## Installation

- Extract the platform into your **`Platforms`** Directory.
- Add an entry to Cactus called **`Lament of Innocence (1.06a)`** that launches
  **`Game.exe`**, with the flags set to **`-direct`**.

## Known Issues

- None

## Porting Fixes

- The mod normally depends on another launcher for its hooking mechanism. I used
  the **`D2ModSetup.bat`** included in **`D2Mod102`** to patch the
  **`D2gfx.dll`** on **`1.10`** so that it loads **`D2Mod.dll`**. Everything
  loaded properly after that.
- Removed **PlugY**.
