## Patch Notes

```
[27.FEB.2011] MEDIAN XL 1.Z9 RELEASED!

The latest and greatest Median XL patch features a cube recipe overhaul to make
them more straightforward and intuitive, as well as a number of skill changes
and a large amount of usability fixes and drop rate tweaks.

In particular, the focus on the endgame has been reduced a bit, enabling you to
find better items early on while increasing the difficulty of the early game.

Get the patch now on the download page.

[11.FEB.2011] MEDIAN XL 1.G9b RELEASED!

A handful of balance changes and most importantly some new skills!

Update: replaced corrupted file so those invisible monsters are visible again.
Thanks a lot, Excel.

[09.FEB.2011] MEDIAN XL 1.G9 RELEASED!

Stumbled over Landmasses or any of the other 'not too balanced' monsters? This
patch fixes that!

[13.JAN.2011] MEDIAN XL 1.F9h RELEASED!

It seems the last major bug is removed. These iterative patches are fun!

[09.JAN.2011] MEDIAN XL 1.F9g RELEASED!

Another minor fix to clean up some bugged skills and items.

[04.JAN.2011] MEDIAN XL 1.F9f RELEASED!

More bugfixes and a few boosts to underused builds. We're approaching perfection
here, folks.

[30.DEC.2010] MEDIAN XL 1.F9e RELEASED!

Some bugfixes and balance changes and notably the reintroduction of the mighty
Cornerstone of the World in single player.

ModDB is hosting its annual Mod of the Year contest. Last year Median XL
finished 6th out of over 10,000 mods! Let's do better this year.

Second round: Lost...  Diablo 2 is showing its age. After finishing in a
commendable spot last year, it is no longer in the top 10. It probably came in
at around #30-#40, which is not bad in and of itself, but still...

[25.NOV.2010] MEDIAN XL 1.F9d RELEASED!

A minor update to correct some missing item names.

[24.NOV.2010] MEDIAN XL 1.F9c RELEASED!

A new patch has been released. It contains a lot of new unique items (225!) and
a handful of runewords.

Get the patch now on the download page.

[11.JUL.2010] WAKING UP

Now that Starcraft 2 has proven itself to be completely useless for serious
mapmaking, this might be the time to get back into Median XL.

I can't make any promises as to when, since Starcraft 2 has left me burned out
and I need a break. Shame it was all for nothing since the publishing system
sucks ice cream cones.

[27.FEB.2010] MOD OF THE YEAR #6!

This update is a bit delayed, but better late than never.

Top Ten Mod of the Year!  Median XL scored #6 in the ModDB Mod of the Year
Player's Choice contest, out of more than ten thousand mods for just about any
game.

This is a great achievement for a mod for such an old game as Diablo II. Thanks
for your votes.

There was even some growth potential left, because the number of Median XL votes
was among the highest of any mod. Most were unregistered votes though.

Median Mean Mode Due to the imminent release of Starcraft II and its editor, and
my plans to create a Dota Killer using this editor and engine, not much time is
left for future Median XL content patches.

Therefore I handed over the spin-off project Mean Mode to Median fans Borgin and
Xypherous.

They will develop this 'mod of a mod' over the next few months. It is intended
to be a harder and more tactical version of Median XL. More updates to come.

[02.FEB.2010] MEDIAN XL 1.F9b PATCH RELEASED!

A few very small bugfixes to 1.F9.

[30.JAN.2010] MEDIAN XL 1.F9 PATCH RELEASED!

It can't get much better, and it won't get any better. The la(te)st major Median
XL release, 1.F9 is available on the download page.

The highlight is that the somewhat chaotic necromancer trees were revamped to a
more logical structure, with fewer of the hated totems and more direct damage.

Other builds were improved as well, resulting in more gameplay variety.

VOTE!

Second voting round: ModDB Mod of the Year 2009 Median XL has passed the first
round and is in the Top 100 out of over 10,000 mods! Thanks everyone!

Now the second voting round is under way. Click on the 'Mod of the Year' image
on the right, scroll down to the vote button and vote! If you have a ModDB
account, use it: registered votes are much more important.

[03.JAN.2010] MEDIAN XL 1.E9 PATCH RELEASED!

A new year, a new patch. This is a significant update, introducing a number of
medium level challenges to keep you entertained on your trek to the top. Click
on the Challenges menu on the left to learn more.

Also, many skills and builds were improved and there is a major overhaul to
blocking and two-handed weapons in order to make both build paths viable.

There are also new item-only skills, new signets, balance changes to elite
monsters, a new Baal fight and bugfixes. If you have patch 1.13, there is a
respec elixir.

[11.DEC.2009] DIABLO II 1.13 RELEASED - I'M ON IT

The 1.13 Test Realm is live. The patch seems to introduce a lot of useless
changes and an important one - a skill/stat undo function ('respec').

Preliminary testing tells me that Median XL 1.D9c works fine with 1.13, except
from a few text bugs. However, I will see if it is possible to introduce
unlimited respecs into Median XL instead of the single shot respec Blizzard
reserved for single player, and if so, a patch is coming!

[18.NOV.2009] MEDIAN XL 1.D9c PATCH RELEASED!

The new patch improves skill and item balance, notably replacing numerous
useless skills and trees with improved and viable ones.

[03.AUG.2009] MINOR UPDATE

Patch 1.A9c is a small patch that corrects a few issues in 1.A9.

[19.JUL.2009] MAJOR UPDATE

New Median XL patch released Patch 1.A9 follows 1.99 and contains a number of
major improvements. You get numerous new character skills, 60 new runewords, 3
additional great runes and a new challenge!
