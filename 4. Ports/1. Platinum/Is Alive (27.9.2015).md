## Includes

- Cactus Platform (1.10)
- Is Alive (27.9.2015)

## Installation

- Extract the platform into your **`Platforms`** Directory.
- Add an entry to Cactus called **`Is Alive (27.9.2015)`** that launches
  **`Game.exe`**, with the flags set to **`-direct`**.

## Known Issues

- None

## Porting Fixes

- The mod normally depends on another launcher for its hooking mechanism. I used
  the **`D2ModSetup.bat`** included in **`D2Mod102`** to patch the
  **`D2gfx.dll`** on **`1.10`** so that it loads **`D2Mod.dll`**. Once that was
  done, I rewired the rest of the dlls by:
	- Adding **`PlugY.dll`** to **`D2Mod.ini`** at the first position.
- Installed **`PlugY 9.00`**, and used the **`PlugY.ini`** provided by the mod.

## Patch Notes

```
I'm happy to announce, that after three years of development, full version of
the mod is finally here! Never thought I could manage to make the idea real.
That I could do what I like and be so successful. You know, I'm just a regular
guy who likes to play games and modify the most favourite one of them. I'd like
to thank you all for your support, for your coments and help.

What's this mod about? First I'd like to mention, it's a mod which respects the
original game. It evolves the aspects of vanilla. It doesn't make the game
completely different, instead, it makes the game deeper, more subtile. You won't
find any new or modified uniques, sets, runes, runewords. But you'll encounter
new monsters, new crafting system, new locations, new gems, new quests, new
challenges.
