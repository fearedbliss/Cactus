## Patch Notes

```
Ancestral Recall v1.10 Build for LOD v1.10 Final -> By TeknoKyo 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Note: Didn't make any changes except ported to LOD v1.10 final.
Very bz with stocks and Ragnarok online now. Won't be workin on mod till my Ragnarok
char reaches at least 90.

Read thru the whole thing if you've never tried AR. Especially the installation.

Installation
------------

Make a new sub-folder called AR in your D2/LOD folder(Default is C:\Program Files\Diablo II)
- The AR folder should look something like this C:\Program Files\Diablo II\AR
- Unzip all the files to AR folder
- Run AR with AR.Bat

Additions to Current Build.
--------------------------

-Most are tentative but most probably finalised if I'm lazy.
-Added runeword recipes so that you can use any weapon, armor with the needed runes to 
 create variant crafted items based on the runeword. 
 ie ... you can do a "Breath of the Dying" Claw with any claw + the req runes.
-Added some new recipes based on LOD v1.08 based uniques, ie -> Shako +40% life,etc,
 refer to recipe page or forum.
-Added in a more new monsters with diff AI/skills etc all over.
-Changed some drops again, ie .Corpsefire will now drop all the basic uniqs again. 
 Amber/Jade/Sapphire will drop a uniq item most of the time.
-Moved some superuniques around, some new, some old to make it more interesting.
-Mausoleum will have some Super Skeletons that drop Act 4-5 items, so if you want to get 
 better items early on, visit there. 
-Crypts is still a kill diablo then enter area.
-Act 2 changes, if you take the dungeon route to get the staff+viper amy, it'll be mostly
 undeads, If you take the outdoors thru Fangskin, it'll be mostly non-undead. Made it so 
 that diff character has advantages on the diff route.
-Act 2 revamp almost done, still some monsters + things to take care of.
-Act 4 has more changes, the 3 diablo guardians are new demons with new skills, might change
 again later.
-SnapChip changed for this build.
-On Act 1, If you come across a Bridge, there'll be trolls(Savage), If you kill them, you'll
 get Gems, Norm = Chipped, NM = Flawed, Hell = Normal, this is done so that you can do
 recipe requiring Chipped/Flawed Gems. Trolls will only appear on Bridges and nowhere else 
 in the game.
-Ancient Kaa has unique drops but be careful. Act 2 Tombs. He's more powerful than most superuniques.
-Think there are around 50 or more new monsters and still lots to do.

Additions to v1.08.
------------------

Act 1 is fully revamped for now ... 2,3,4,5 will be on later. Once done I'll release
another version.

-Act 2,3,4,5 has some additional monsters but will be revamped again.
-Additionals will come in later after I'm done with Act 2-5 revamps.
-Remember to always use a hireling, you'll most probably need to get a hireling asap + throw
 in a weapon to make sure you get all the help you can to play AR on Act 1. There's a 
 purpose of having Asheara and Greitz in Act 1 and the purpose is to help. Get a pole type 
 weapon on Greitz hire to inrease the dmg multiple times, Sword on Asheara, Bow on Kasha  hire. 
-Amber,Jade,Sapphire has hi % of sets/uniq drops, so kill them as many times as you want to 
 try getting better equipment.
-All the superuniques in Act 1 is different from LOD originals for now, some others in 2-5 
 has also been changed for this release but not finalised.
-too lazy to type anymore so I'm just gonna leave it to you ppl to find the new things.

ARBeta-S for LOD v1.10s changes.
--------------------------------

Addition ... Due to the new Item seeds/coding ... a lot of items will be deleted. Backup your chars for use on the final release with your old items. There could be a bug in the item seed that makes all the unique, rares, sets disappear. Well, this is an incentive for you to tryout diff areas in all difficulties again to get all back all the sets/uniques that  your char was equipped with and test out the new monsters ... ;)

For this release, I've put in some additional monsters in all acts. LMK if any of the new 
monsters don't work or gets crashed. Some are brand new instead of replacement.

This is just a Beta for testing purpose... Only for AR-CS with bigger stash.

-> LMK what are the places/oddities.
-> Drops and recipes are as per AR v1.07 - LMK if the recipes still work.
-> Check out the crypts and see if you can kick Natalya's S ... :)
-> Some new monsters added in, still a lot but most prob I won't make it more than 20 MB.
-> The engine is basically something like this in terms of experience/levelling.
-> Areas are still the same for now. Should work, short cuts to later acts should still work.

For bug/test reports -> put it in the PhrozenKeep-AR forum, I'll be releasing future beta,
so if you wanna be on later Beta test list ... try to help out.

Enjoy, it's FREE.


*** READ THRU THE WHOLE THING IF YOU NEVER PLAYED AR BEFORE ***


Please post at my forum at PhrozenKeep on which version you like/play ... I'll most 
probably only update on the 1 that ppl mostly play. If there are not many ppl who plays
either AR mod ... I'll just stop public releases and help other mod-makers make mods that
ppl play ... :)

For Bug reports or anything that u wanna talk about ... put it in the forums 

Forum: http://www.planetdiablo.com/teknokyo/ <- go here and click forums link, there is a link to TeknoKyo Mod Forum under Specific Mods.

Pls use the forum instead of emailing me so that every1 can help each other and myself.


IMPORTANT MUST DO Instructions:
-------------------------------

-Make a backup of the file Patch_D2.mpq in your Diablo2 directory before copying this mod    over it.  
 (Most probably located in C:\Program Files\Diablo II)
-Make a backup of your char files that you wanna use for this mod b4 playing. 
 (C:\Program Files\Diablo II\save)
-To install ... just unzip the Patch_D2.mpq into your Diablo II folder.
-Play the game in Hell for the best experience.
-Remember you can use your existing chars to play the this mod and try playing Hell.
-You can start a new char with this mod and then use that char on normal LOD too.
-Use "players 2" for normal AR(Natalya10x) play, Use "players 3-8" for Harder to extreme
 play. I usually play on "players 4"(20x) for Norm/NM and "Players 2"(10x) on Hell

For new players:
----------------
-Crypts-Burial Grounds -Act 1 is as hard as Act4 and Act5 ... so most probably it's too hard
 unless your char can at least kill diablo.
-Lvling and difficulty - intended completion levels Norm=40, NM=70, HELL = ??
-Make sure you kill Blood Raven in Norm for an early boost.
-In Blood Moor ... when starting new chars ... go for Nest Kills ... it'll give u a few good  lvls mabbe up to lvl 10 for another early boost ... but it won't be that easy.
-Killing Corpsefire will give you good startup items ... this is how I play on Realms.
-Try starting new characters to take advantage of the new skills.
-Make sure you read thru all the changes on all AR versions from ARv1.00 to the latest
 release to know what is changed on AR.
-Make sure you check the scrshots on my site to see the new things in AR
-Look thru the AR Info, Maps, Cube Recipes, Hirelings pages on my site for before
 starting out. 

*** Changes that might affect chars(You still can revert back) - Only for AR-SE ***
- Skills are changed and chars will not be the same when u use your existing chars, your      chars will be a lot more powerful
- Reverting back to Original LOD will affect char skills. 
- Added in Megainventory, cube, stash, increase, so reverting back to normal LOD might
  result in Item loss ... the Megainventory is done by Fusman(IMHO 1 of the coolest D2
  modders) and Phalzyr ... so if all Credits goes to them ... :)


Release/Upgrade Info for current version:
-----------------------------------------

Some additions and fixes. Revamped Ancient Tunnels in Lost City Act II.

v1.07 Additions/Changes
-----------------------
-Revamped Ancient Tunnels - entry from Lost City Act 2 ... this area is now controlled 
 by a new type of wolf ... The wolfs are called dire-wolfs but using new/different gfx ...
 area is a lot bigger now.
-Dire-wolfs has lvls that are the same as monsters on Lost City Act II ... but higher
 defense,dmgs, exp. Drops are based on Act 5 .. which means you can start getting better
 items on Act 2 if you go into Ancient Tunnels... this is intended to boost your char
 with the extra exp,lvls and items to continue on thru the rest of the Acts.
-Added Camels which will only appear in Unique/champion group format and Randomly and
 only on Far Oasis ... yeah ... Oasis should sometimes have Camels.
-Camel drops -> Unique/Champions = Runes, Minions = Gems... Rune/Gems Drops are scaled
 accordingly for Norm/NM/Hell.
-Fixed some bugs/oddities ... ie. mercenary "cannot complete request bug" ... should've been
 done since v1.00 ... LMK if any1 still gets this problem.
-Some-more recipes added in ... now there's socketing recipes for normal items ... which
 should've been there in place of the magic items socketing ... magic item socketing is
 still there and left as it is ... refer AR-Cube info page on site.
-There are some recipes that causes problems/crash on certain items but left alone cus 
 it works on other items.... this will most certainly stay like this cus it's easier for
 me as a 1 line added instead of few hundred lines for each item that works.
-Try the Horse Boot recipe - it's done to cut-down travelling time... but also useful for
 evasion purpose
-Some specific drops are changed back to always set ... Duriel(H), Nihlatak(NM) ...etc  
-Some gameplay changes.


v1.06 Additions
---------------
-Revamped Drifter Cavern(New area off Ancients Way) into another Cow-Level ... 
 this plays a lot differently.
-The cows will just crowd around you but won't harm you ... this is done for homicide type
 gameplay ... just go kill the cows ... the drops are all new items that can only be found
 here.
-The Sorceress-cow-herders pack quite some magic punch ... try to have full resistance b4
 venturing in here. They don't like you killing the cows... ;)
-A lot more recipes added from the cow drops. Now you can make set items, reroll set items
 to get the ring, ammy you want ...etc, make socketed items tailored to the rune words
 ...etc
-Nerf some skills that make chars into Gods ... ie ... Charged Bolt, Teeth ... etc.
-Made changes to hirelings so that certain hirelings won't crash the game when moving from
 Hell back to norm/nm ... LMK if hirelngs causes game crashes.
-Made some changes to item drops
-Made some monster changes ... gameplay based.
-Some other changes
-Now I'm off to play Throne of Darkness and wanna start playing Pool of Radiance 2... :)


v1.05 Additions
---------------

-A lot more cube recipe added - refer Cube recipe page
-Some cube recipes require quest related items so you won't be able to use them unless you
 haven't done the quest yet ... the recipe gives better items than the quest rewards.
-Hell level Hirelings has more attack skills now ... 
 ie. Firewall, FrozenOrb, Exploding Arrow, New auras ...etc
-Druid elemental skills revamped with a lot more damage.
-Necro summons do more damage now, skeletons, revives, golems ...etc.
-Poison Dagger Necros is very powerfull if you use the Gidbinn cube recipe + Max Poison
 dagger ... this variant can match any melee char in terms of dmg now.
-Changes to Act 5 maps ... refer maps on my site ... now you can get to Nihlatak again
 after completing the quest.
-Added in Permanet Waypoint to Cow-Level ... must complete game in respective diff and
 must hit waypoint in Black Marsh. U can kill the cow-king as many times as you want.
-Lots of changes to Crypts to make it more playable for every1 ... 1st four levels cut
 down in size by half. Better items from armor/weapon stands, changes to 
 monsters/variety ...etc
-Fire golems summoned by Natalya is a whole lot more powerfull now ... carefull.
-Hell level Hirelings has more attack skills now ... 
 ie. Firewall, FrozenOrb, Exploding Arrow, New auras ...etc
-Changes to monsters .. ie. removed FireEnchanted from Andy like Baal minion, Moe, Natalya,
 etc.
-Changes to set drops, random drops ... now mons that gives out sets will give 
 rares/uniques on top of sets.
-Superunique drops more using the bug is more randomised now to include Baal drops.
-Some other changes.
 

v1.04 Additions 
---------------
-Act maps are different from normal LOD now ... did it to provide alternate/new ways to 
 play the game. Note that all monsters in the new area are different from what it was.
-Act 1 Crypt is now 16 lvls deep with a huge variety of monsters from all acts ... be warned
 that this place is real huge and has some of the toughest monsters in the game ... so it'll
 be a good idea to finish Diablo before attempting this area.
 Natalya is at the very end. If you have completed Normal and decide to go thru this area
 on NM and Hell ... there's an alternate way to complete Act 1 by killing Andy in 1 of the
 caves here but it's a lot tougher than the normal Andy.
-Act 1 main quest areas are shortened for faster completion ... ie. Stony Field goes
 straight to Dark wood without going thru Underground Passage...etc.
 refer to maps on my site.
-Act 2 - Main Quest Area shortened. ie. Far Oasis goes straight to Maggots Lair lvl 3.
-Act 2 - Two ways thru different Areas to get Horadic Staff.
 Alternate staff route is thru multiple lvl tomb which starts at Dry Hills -> Stony Tomb 1  .. Staff items are on Bloodwitch. Note that Random chance it won't drop due to LOD v1.09
-Act 3 - Main Quest Area shortened. ie. Flayer Jungle straight into Dungeon 3 to get 1 of
 the Khalim item ... can't remember what it is.
-Act 3 - Provided a way to skip Act 4 completely if you complete this multi-level Dungeon
 and kill Diablo. 
 Flayer Jungle -> Swampy Pit ... be warned that the Diablo you meet here is a lot tougher
 than the normal Diablo in Act 4 and comes in multiples ... just 1 kill will be enuf to
 skip Act 4 completely.
-Act 4 ... no changes here ... will think about it in next release.
-Act 5 - Main area still the same ... only change to main quest area is Temple-> Nihlatak
 without goin thru the other 2 lvls.
-Act 5 - New area off Ancient's Way->Halls of something ... ->Icy Cellar for a new uber  Monster called Spin. This may be a lot tougher than Crypts for certain Char or mabbe all  chars.
-Added in some new cube recipes/crafted items ... ie. runes can be 3 -> 1 next lvl 
 up to Zod, 
-Provide some recipes for crafted life/mana/dual leech rings/ammy
-3 rare rings -> 1 rare ammy, 3 ring ammy-> 1 rare ring, 3 uniq ring-> 1 rare ammy ...etc
-Some crafted 200-300% dmg weapon recipes.
-Check on my site for the added recipes.
-Only on AR-SE ... Some changes to skills .. ie. Barb Find Item now works fine,     nerfed/enhanced/re-scaled some skills, ... most of the nerfed skills are Paladin Aura
 that monsters used to cause 1 hit kills.
-Lots of gameplay changes to AR especially on monsters.
-Other changes
-Forgot about permanent waypoint to Cow-Level again ... next release ... :)
 

v1,03 Additions
---------------
-I don't even know how to tell you to take advantage of the new skills, but I'll try.
-Every single skill revamped to have better dmg,tohit,bonus,lowered mana ... etc
-If I really wanna go into every single change, It'll be 3-4 pages long.
-Hopefully some1 can set up an AR skills guide and I'll link to that site... :)
-Here are just some hi-lites.
-Sorceress has 2 new kicks in place of IceBolt and IceBlast. This will be the 1st time you   can use item leech on sorcs skills.
 IceBolt = Magic Dmg kick with some Phys Dmg for leech. Can use item effects ... 
 ie.. monster flee when hit, life + mana leech on items ... very usefull.
 IceBlast = Ice Dmg kick + Freeze, + item effect.
 Item effect allows weapon dmg added in to the skills.
 eg Icebolt 300 magic + 300dmg orb  = 600 dmg total, bear in mind ... leech will work only   on phys dmg done. 
-Orbs now looks like orbs ... round and held in palm like potions(exploding) ... this is to
 make the kicks look good during play ... all orbs doubled in dmg and is 100% str and  100%  dex bonus to allow better leech  and  higher dmg for sorceress. 
 Sorceress that can do leech  + mega range dmg is a godsend ... 
 try this combo, Lvl20 icebolt = 600-700+ magic dmg + 200dmg orb + leech rings/ammy/items +  energy  shield +  Chilling armor + another elemental range dmg skill will make sorcs almost  untouchable. 
-Assassin has a new phys dmg kick(no leech) in place of Psychic Hammer.
 Does around 6000+ dmg at lvl 23   with around 25 mana. This kick can be used like Barb ww
 ... hold down mouse near  any  target(not on) and keep kicking/killing monsters by just
 moving mouse while holding  down  button till run out of mana. It'll remind you of Bruce
 Lee/Jet Li/Jacky Chan and it's the best looking attack in AR now.
 Some strategy with this move... use it with a charge up attack for life/mana leech, and
 finish off monsters with this move. Note: this is not a finishing move but does a lot more
 dmg than any current finishing moves even with 9 lvl 20 charge up orbs spinning. 
-Trap Assassin that is setup like a normal sorceress(hi mana) can also use this move for     fast kills with fast mana regens. 
-Assassin traps are all increased in dmg and most probably you can complete AR HEll without
 Martial Arts at all.
-Necro teeth is now an item effect but it's still lightning, so you won't get to leech with
 it. Every Necro spell has been increased in dmg/lowered mana ...etc ... except CE. 
-Paladin ... make sure you take a look at my 1st time playing paladin scrshot on my site.
 Auras increased, dmg increased, etc
-I'm too lazy to type anymore ... there's still a lot of changes done.
 basically, all dmg skills(phys/elemental) start showing potential especially after you've
 16 points in it ... that's where the real big dmg starts.
 The purpose I did it like this is to provide more replayability instead of making all chars
 into jack-of-all-trades. You won't get real good hitpower below 16points. 
 The system is now like this 1-7 some added dmg, 8-15 more added dmg, >= 16 huge dmg added.
 All this is added on top of the current LOD dmg. Normal LOD has almost even dmg from 1-20.
-Expect to see huge dmgs/bonus when u touch skill lvl 20.
-1 very important change to skills that affect monsters is this ... monsters that make use
 of char skills will do a whole lot more dmg ... this'll make AR a lot more challenging.
-Added in Fusman's + Phalzyr Megainv plugin... this'll make a lot of ppl happy
 All credits to them on this ... I didn't do anychange on it.
-Other changes to make AR better.


v1.02 Additions
---------------
-Lots of Gameplay balancing done. 
-AR is now 5xHP/EXP ... to make it more playable for lots more ppl. Now you can play AR at
 the difficulty you want. 
 Use "players 2" for normal AR(Natalya10x) play, Use "players 3-8" for Harder to extreme  play.
-Removed/Lowered Physical Resistance on certain monsters in Hell for better gameplay for 
 physical dmg chars.
-Necro = Big Boost ... can now do Lightnin + Cold on top of poison and Magic dmg. 
 All necro direct dmg spells increased in dmg + lowered mana reqs for better/fun gameplay 
 in AR. There are now a lot of more play options/variants for Necro instead of    Revive/IronMaiden/CE due to the added Lightnin and Cold hi dmg spells.
 Maxed out Teeth, BoneSpear, BoneSpirit + Mana makes Necro into a good lightnin+cold+magic   killing machine + real fun guy to play especially in Hell to offset the various immunities.
 Norm/NM should be an easy stroll even with "Players 2" ... Hell is where the new changes    makes a whole lot of difference.
-Sorceress = Big Boost, Lowered mana reqs, Sorceress in AR is no more a weakling now.
 Fire/Lightnin/Cold spells all do a lot more dmg especially with maxed out Mastery.
 With the changes ... you don't even need Static at all to finish the game, after all it 
 only does 50% in Hell.
-More specific drops for starting characters ... Corpsefire, Bishibosh, 
 Sarina(Old Coldcrow), Blood Raven, Rakanishu, etc. Info will be updated on site.
-Runes+gems drop a lot more now. Almost all superuniques will drop a rune when killed.
 This is done in preparation for the next release when I start making/changing cube recipes.
-Made changes so that specific drops that don't occur on superuniques will have a
 rune/gem/ring/ammy instead of blue items ... This could be a LODv1.09 bug 
 after changes was done to superunique drops but I just used it to my advantage. 
-A lot of playbalance on monsters done.
-some other changes.

v1.01 Additions
---------------
-Upgrade to run on LOD v1.09
-Cow King will now drop cow-leathers instead of any unique cow in cow level
-Major change to Sorceress, Necro, Druid Spells ... all do double base ... this should make
 spell casters more a lot more powerful and playable in this mod.
-Cut down a lot of Spike Giants from Act 3.
-Some monster sound changes.
-NPC buy back now at 100K,125K,150K ... since Blizz decided to change this file, I should do
 it too ... :)
-Blood Raven only drops Cube in Normal now ... stupid me ... didn't think about it b4.
-Blood Raven will now drop Mavina's Caster in Hell for u to complete the set.
-Made some changes to monster immunity becus this the calc is changed in LOD v1.09. Took me
 by surprise when I saw the Iron Golems immune to physical, fire, ice, poison ... it's like
 they became invulnerable... LMK if there are monsters with more than 2 immunities besides
 superuniques.
-Some minor changes to Global item drops.
-Make some changes to uniques monsters appearing.
-Some other changes.


Ancestral Recall - V1.00 Additions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Lots of new monsters including wolf, iron golems, blood golems, rogues, guards, iron wolf,
 spirit baboon, quill bears, scimitars, variants, etc, more monsters will be in final mod
-Some new and switched around superuniques, added in Butcher, blood golem summoner, iron
 golem summoner ... the hardest monster in the game will most probably be the iron golem 
 summoner which is at where Hephasto used to be ... Hephasto is now located as 1 of the     seal monster. FireEye is a now a Unique Guard that drops Aldurs set in NM and Hell.
-3 Stooges -> Korlic, Madawc, Talic now gives exp when killed second time and has very good
 drops ... same as Baal for now... most probably will change in final version.
-Lots more uniques/champions in ever area/location/acts.
-Tweaked some monsters AI and stats for better gameplay/challenge..
-More set drops ... can complete Aldurs(FireEye ... Act2), Griswold Legacy(Griswold), 
 Bul Kathos(Iron Golem Sommoner-Act 4 where Hephasto is) ... final mod will try to get
 all sets in
-Baal now provides a lot better drops for NM and Hell
-Minor skills increased for starting skill for sorc, necro, druid to get you started if you
 wanna start a new char
-More unique rings/ammy drops.
-The unique runic talon that Natalya drops in Norm now has 130% damage instead of 35% ...
 you can even revert back to Normal LOD and the 130% dmg stays... more to come in final mod
-All towns has more NPC that you can hire from. 
-Cut down a lot of annoying monsters like leapers, swarms, maggots, fetish, flayers and
 replace with new monsters... still a lot to be done here.
Added in after Beta:
-More monsters added in ... almost every single area in every act plays differently  now  including non-essential areas... more changes to this after v1.09
-Every exceptional set items will be drop from superuniques or certain monsters.
-Some visual only changes like pimping Greitz... :)
-Baal is harder now and can regenerate ... so don't waste time with hits. All baal minions  superuniques changed.
-Added in a Moe-the butcher ... really tough guy ... it's lvl 40/70/90 ... so most probably you gotta reach those levels before attempting to kill him ...but he gives out uniques of Baal Drops.
-Harem has monsters now... :)
-Can't remember what other changes ... but there a still a lot that I didn't mention... and I don't want to mention some spoilers.

A whole lot more changes will come in after v1.09 and after I finally complete Hell playing Druid ... haven't even reach Act 2 norm yet.


Old features that were in My Natalya 10x mod v1.00 - Main features 
------------------------------------------------------------------
-All Monsters are 10x harder to kill but you get 10x more experience... resulting in very
 fast lvl ups.
-Added Fire Golem as a new monster. Can appear as Unique and Champions.
-Added Natalya as a new superunique that summons the Fire Golems in the Crypts.
-Killing Natalya will result in specific Item drops. 
 Hell = Full Set of Natalya's Odium, 
 NM = Natalya's Mark x2, 
 Norm = Greater Talons x2,   Unique Cutthroat + another rare Greater Talons.
 Sometimes you'll get a rare instead of an Odium Item ... if this happens, just go kill
 Natalya again in the Crypts.
 Suggestion : If you can kill Duriel then most probably you'll survive Crypts and able to
 kill Natalya. It's suicide to even go near her you can't kill Duriel.
-Lowered all items base lvl to use at Char lvl 50 ... but mods on items that require higher
 lvls will stay at the higher lvl. This will allow you to use any set/Base/Unique items once  you reach Lvl 50.
-Items Selling Capped at 100K instead of 25K thruout all Acts and Difficulty
-Item Drops are a lot better ... Hi% of Unique/Rare Items on Unique Monsters.
-Rune Drops are better ... but I think runes sucks ... even if the runewords are  enabled.
-Some other changes that I can't remember now.

Credits and Greetz:
- My wife who has been so ever patient with me ... and made my life complete ... :)
- Blizzard, especially Blizzard North for making a real cool game and making modding
  even easier on LOD ... this is the kind of coding that other software company should
  learn from.
