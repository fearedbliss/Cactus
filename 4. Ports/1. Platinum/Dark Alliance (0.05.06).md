## Includes

- Cactus Platform (1.10)
- Dark Alliance (0.05.06)

## Installation

- Extract the platform into your **`Platforms`** Directory.
- Add an entry to Cactus called **`Dark Alliance (0.05.06)`** that launches
  **`Game.exe`**.

## Known Issues

- None

## Porting Fixes

- The mod will normally force save to the **`save`** directory in
  your Diablo II Root Directory. However, I've edited the **`PlugY.ini`**
  and changed **`ActiveSavePathChange`** to **`0`**, which allows Cactus
  to manage the folder.
