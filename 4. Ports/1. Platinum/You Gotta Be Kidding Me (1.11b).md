Content: 1. Description 2. Compatibility 3. Installation 4. Credits 5. Contact

--------------------------------------

1. DESCRIPTION This is a mod for Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction. It was made to
celebrate the Arpil Fools day, so don't be surprised if you find characters from
different games/shows and funny dialogues from the NPCs.

--------------------------------------

2. COMPATIBILITY The mod is compatible with Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction v1.10
and v.1.11, both PC and Mac versions. Attempting to run the mod on a different
version of Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction isn't recommended.

--------------------------------------

3. INSTALLATION

3.1. On PC: Backup your Patch_d2.mpq (located in your Diablo II folder) and then
replace it with the Patch_D2.mpq of the mod. Then run the game as usual. To
uninstall, replace the modded file with the original.

3.2. On Mac: Backup your Diablo II Patch (Carbon) (or Diablo II Patch in older
versions of MacOS), then copy the Patch_d2.mpq of the mod in your Diablo II
folder and rename it to Diablo II Patch (Carbon) (or Diablo II Patch in older
versions of MacOS). Run the game as usual. To uninstall, replace the modded file
with the original.

--------------------------------------

4. CREDITS I'd like to thank everyone who's work I used in this mod, namely cafa
and Volf, and the whole d2mod.com modmaking community. I'd also like to thank
all the game sprite and sound rippers in the internet, without their rips this
mod wouldn't have been possible.
