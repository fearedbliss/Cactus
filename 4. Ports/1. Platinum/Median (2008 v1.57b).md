Item changes

- Implemented 'Sacred' items. Sacred items are essentially 'tier 7' items, and
  have better stats and higher requirements than tier 6 items, but are much
harder to find. Sacred items cannot be unique or set, and there is no way to
create a sacred item in the cube unless the input item is sacred as well.
- Staves, orbs, sceptres, wands and scythes may now spawn with an ‘energy
  factor’ bonus.  This modifier has 50-75% chance to spawn on white, grey, blue
and yellow items. It has 100% chance to spawn on unique and set items. Its value
is based on item type and tier; one-handed weapons go up to +50 at tier 6,
two-handed weapons up to +100.

As you may know if you have played this mod before, skills gain a damage bonus
from energy. However, the amount of bonus damage gained per point into energy
decreases with each additional point. What this modifier does is enable
additional points into energy to grant a significant bonus until much higher
levels of energy.

In other words, whereas the benefits of energy start to taper off at about
250-300 energy if you do not have any 'energy factor' bonus, you will continue
to gain noticable benefits until 1000-1200 energy or more if you have an 'energy
factor' of +100.

This table lists the spell damage bonus at a given energy level (left column)
and energy factor (top row):

... table truncated, look at original file (fearedbliss) ...

As you see, pumping energy makes sense now, at least if you are using a staff or
one-handed caster weapon.

- Greatly reduced strength/dexterity bonus to melee/throwing weapon damage.
  Notice!  If you use weapon-based physical attacks, your damage on the
character sheet will drop compared to 1.47, sometimes dramatically. But do not
worry!  --> Firstly, the global physical resistance has been removed from
monsters, so you will be doing x1.33 damage in Terror difficulty and x2 damage
in Destruction difficulty.  --> Secondly, many characters in 1.47 hit the 82K
damage cap, meaning their damage 'rolled over' to a very low amount of damage on
striking. If you did more than 82K damage, your real damage done will be higher
now even if the listed damage on your character screen is lower.

The progression formula for the elemental conversion skills is a modified dm
formula:

Skill level	Conversion % 1	5 2	10 3	14 4	18 5	22 6	25 7
28 8	31 9	34 10	36 11	39 12	41 13	43 14	45 15	47 16	48 17
50 18	52 19	53 20	55 21	56 22	57 23	58 24	60 25	61 26	62 27
63 28	64 29	65 30	66

Elemental conversion is useful, because there is a global 25% physical
resistance in Terror and 50% in Destruction difficulty. Converting your physical
damage to elemental damage allows you to circumvent the physical resistance,
increasing your damage.
