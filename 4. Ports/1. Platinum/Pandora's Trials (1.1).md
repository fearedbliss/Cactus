## Patch Notes

```
Pandora's Trials will be a vanilla 1.13c mod, based on the legend of Pandora's
Box, and it housing the indisposable evil.

Major features:
- Leveling: Tired of long process of getting your character to desired level ?
  This mod doesn't simply increase the experience gain and call it an
improvement. Something that has been long missing in this game will finally make
an appearance. Scroll-based side quests. During chaotic times like these, people
are no doubt in need of resources. Fetch the desired items to be rewarded with
experience and variety of different rewards.
- Wisdom System: A new, fully adjustable system of passive bonuses. Collect
  ancient knowledge to gain wisdom, which, on reaching required milestones, will
offer you an option to pick one of available bonuses. Should new bonuses be
implemented, you can reset your wisdom points and reassign them again !
- Alchemy System: Quite an important feature that the game has been missing
  aswell. Collect herbs to craft your very own potions with various effects.
Stronger, instantenious, or long lasting ? It is up to you to decide.
- Smithing System: Tired of having to pick out of existing, pre-made items ?
  Create your own unique items with attributes of your choice, in new endgame
smithing system. Don't use what you actually don't want just because there is
this one bonus that you need !
- Pandora's Trials: Acquire Pandora's Box to access new locations full of
  powerful enemies and even better rewards ! Some locations are only available
during certain time however !
