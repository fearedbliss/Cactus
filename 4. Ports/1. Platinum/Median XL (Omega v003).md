## Patch Notes

```
[04.AUG.2011] MEDIAN XL OMEGA v003 RELEASED!

A smaller patch to polish some rough edges. Warlocks are gone, as are punisher
traps and various other high damage/instakill attacks in the regular campaign.
This should reduce the chance of a nervous breakdown by 82%.

[23.JUN.2011] MEDIAN XL OMEGA v002 RELEASED!

A bugfix patch for Omega that improves several underused skills and fixes a few
annoying problems.

[31.MAY.2011] MEDIAN XL OMEGA RELEASED!

With Diablo 3 just around the corner, this is the last and biggest content
update for Median XL.

New skills Most characters have received a number of skill upgrades. Blaze a
trail with the druid's immunity piercing Mythal, honourably vanquish your foes
with the paladin's Colosseum or rock out to Symphony of Destruction if your
little black heart is into unholy builds, or rofl as monsters faceplant your
sorceress' Force Wall.
