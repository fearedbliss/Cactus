## Patch Notes

```
Patch v6.08 Download

NOTE : All patches will "update" the Plugy.ini and D2mod.ini files. If you have
edited them , it is best to re-edit the versions from RoS patch v6.08+, as they
are more stable for multiplayer gaming then previous plugy versions.....

Patch v6.08 Changes

Requiem of Sorrow has been using Plugy v7.01b, and from what I've been told this
is mainly used for the Official Patch v1.11b. So for this RoS patch (V6.08) I have
taken the advise of others and "replaced" it with Plugy v5.06 , which is suppost
to be the best compatable version for Official Patch v1.10 and should fix any
issues related to multiplayer crashes specific to Plugy itself.

Hopefully this will resolve any problems with Multiplayer TCP/IP Gaming.
However, as I cannot test this myself, I must rely on other people to tell me if
this is the case or if they still experience random crashes while playing TCP/IP
games.

Patch 6.07 Changes

I've uploaded a new Requiem of Sorrow patch v6.07.

This is another "minor update" just like last weeks patch. So ....

Patch 6.07 Changes
-----------------------

Replaced the way Character Heirlooms work, making them truelly Unique. From this
patch on, the Heirlooms start as a Unique item, and the Dragon Vials will only
add bonus properties to them (Instead of making a whole new Unique item, which
lead to some people carrying multiples of them).

Unlike before (were the formulas were based on character level), a new level 1
character 'can' craft all 5 vials of Dragons Blood onto the item, but each vial
will also add a +25 to the Heirlooms character level requirement. Character level
does NOT effect the mods received on an item either. So, only craft the of Dragons
Blood that is equal to or lower then your level, or you will not gain any bonuses
from it until you meet the Heirlooms level requirements.

Also, the properties now added are slightly different (based on character class
and "chance" , as shown below (all properties stack):

1) Level 1 Dragon Blood
+5 to a specific Attribute (Class-Specific)
+2 to a set class skill

1) Level 25 Dragon Blood
+5 to the same specific Attribute as above (Class-Specific)
Reduced vendor prices based on character level (1% per 4 levels)

1) Level 50 Dragon Blood
+5 to the same specific Attribute as above (Class-Specific)
+1-2% Experience Point Bonus
+15-50% to Magic Find

1) Level 75 Dragon Blood
+5 to the same specific Attribute as above (Class-Specific)
+1-2% Additional Experience Point Bonus
+15-50% additional Magic Find Bonus
+1 All Skills

1) Level 100 Dragon Blood
+5 to the same specific Attribute as above (Class-Specific)
+1-2% Additional Experience Point Bonus
+20-40% All Resistance Bonus
+10-15% Damage Reduction Bonus.

Now, I understand you can just keep making new characters and trying to make the
best Heirloom you can, but the mod isnt designed to do this. So if you MUST
cheat .....

Patch 6.06 Changes


Patch 6.06 Changes
-----------------------

1) Edited the Dll files to enable normal and socketed items to be sold in all
   acts and difficulties. Speacial thanks to NEF for posting the offsets.

2) Completely redone the Sorcs "Summon Elemental" Skill and removed the Synergy
   Display error.

3) Fixed Bloodlust Synergy errors. Removed Synergy bonuses from Concentrate.

4) Added 5 new Hells Torment Unique Items.
