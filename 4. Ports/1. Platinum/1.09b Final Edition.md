--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Diablo II Version History
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Patch 1.09b Final
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Downloadable Installer Support

- If all required Diablo 2 '.MPQ' files are installed on the hard drive, 
  the game will no longer require the CD to play. For users that originally 
  performed a 'Full Installation' and wish to run without the CD, all 
  '.MPQ' files should be copied from the Diablo 2 CDs to the Diablo 2 
  directory. Most users will only need to copy D2Music.mpq from the 
  Diablo 2 Play CD and/or D2xMusic.mpq from the Lord of Destruction CD. 
  Mac users will need to copy these music files and rename them to 
  'Diablo II Music' and 'Diablo II Expansion Music' respectively. Anyone 
  who did not perform a 'Full Installation' will need to re-install from 
  CD again to ultimately play without the CD. In this case, a 
  'Full Installation' is required, followed by file copy step noted above.

  Iron Golem on a sword while another tried to pick it up.
