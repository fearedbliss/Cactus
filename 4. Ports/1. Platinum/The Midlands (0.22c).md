## Includes

- Cactus Platform (1.13c)
- The Midlands (0.22c)

## Installation

- Extract the platform into your **`Platforms`** Directory.
- Add an entry to Cactus called **`The Midlands (0.22c)`** that launches
  **`Game.exe`**.

## Known Issues

- None

## Porting Fixes

- The included **PlugY 9.00** files are incompatible with its base platform of
  **1.13c**. Furthermore, testing **14.03** ended up yielding some edge cases
  where skills wouldn't reset properly. So I've deleted it. I have a strong
  feeling that a lot of D2SE packagers are bundling PlugY (and other files)
  into mods that originally didn't have them.

## Patch Notes

```
This mod is a more strategic version of the regular game, but with many new
bosses, skills, and challenges. I would highly recommend forming team of 2 or 3
as the bosses can be very tricky alone.

Some general info:

The first thing you willnotice is there are no Health or Mana potions here.
Healing is instead done via an innate skill every class has. This becomes less
effective as you level up. However, spending points in energy, dexterity or
strength will increase it's healing rate.

All resists are capped at 50 but can be improved with equipment.

Next is the lost soul prison.  This is a handy little tool used for number of
things. Firstly, it records kills directly by you. Spells are included but
minion kills won't count. There are cube recipes later in the game that require
you to have trapped a certain number of souls.  Along with counting slain souls.
It also turns raw materials into components for crafting, it can also be
upgraded and imbued with new properties. See the documentation for more details.

Items: Items are alot more unique now. (Due to the fact there are no (or very
few) "Unique" items) Rares have been improved, along with tempering to create
your own custom item to your specs. All original runewords have been removed and
replaced to a lesser extent.  See the documentation for more details

Skills: A number of new skills for each class and alterations to other skills to
create new build options There are no pre requirements for skills and they are
improved with stat synergies mostly.

Enemys: many new monsters added, and many new bosses. Enemys hit hard and can
take a beating in return. You will need to use your brains and know when to fall
back to recover.  Bosses come with a number of tricks uptheir sleeves. First, if
they are unhurt for 20 seconds.They recover to full health. This is so you have
to killthem in 1 go. No more half dead bosses after you wipe out!  Second, they
have a number of counter attacks. some weak, some not so wak.Some may summon
support and somemay curse you.  They also have another special counter that
renders them curse immune, and grants 100% attack speed, move speed and damage.
This lasts 5 seconds at a time so you may want to back off when this happens.

Changelog:

0.21f Changes: Rune dusts added, barbs concentrate damage reduced.  Druids maul
damage and fury damage increased.  druid summons numbers reduced.  necro summons
cooldown increased.  Block chance on shields reduced to increase the need for
dex.  all 2 hand weapon damages reduced by 20% reduced fps drop on immo and
meteor stacked fire.  made act end boss fights slightly harder and longer
(except normal andariel) Increased mana cost on most spells that require heavy
energy investment so the blue orb is still important.  added rune dusts (new
socketables). These are used for runewords but the new runewords are still to be
completed. I'll add these now so people have a chance to find some and stock up.
