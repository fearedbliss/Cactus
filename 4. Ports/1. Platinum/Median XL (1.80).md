## Patch Notes

```
[04.DEC.2008] MEDIAN XL 1.80 PATCH RELEASED!

How much suffering does it take before you lose your grace?  Despite the long
(several months) alpha and beta test phase, some issues slipped through. It took 
a few patches to set them straight, but now everything is okay.

Discounting a fatal bug, Median XL 1.80 will be the official version for a long
time. Thanks for your continued support throughout the multiple patches of the
previous days.

[03.DEC.2008] MEDIAN XL 1.72 PATCH RELEASED!

Customer-driven value added refocus project Median XL has been a runaway success
with thousands of downloads each day. The mod is perhaps in the top 20 of most
popular mods for any game, ever. Thanks again!

Naturally, Median XL was such a huge project (5 years of incremental
development!) that there were inevitably a few minor issues in the release
version despite the long alpha and beta test phase. This patch fixes the last of
them.

[01.DEC.2008] MEDIAN XL 1.71 PATCH RELEASED!

Over ten thousand!  Median XL has many fans! The first release version has been
downloaded over 10,000 times in the first week. This is far beyond my
expectations. Thanks a lot, all of you.

Patch 1.71 released!  As a reward for the players, I released a minor patch for
Median XL. Patch 1.71 makes some balance adjustments and introduces a new type
of item - gemwords!
