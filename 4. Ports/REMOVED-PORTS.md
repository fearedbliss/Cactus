# Removed Ports

There is currently **1** port that has either been requested by their authors
to not be ported to Cactus, or has been banned from the tree. The reason
will be mentioned. If the mod was dropped due to prunning, then it will be
listed in the next section instead. Prunned mods can be dropped for a variety
of reasons, including subjective reasons, and routine maintenance of the tree.
I want to ensure that I keep a list of high quality and unique mods, and not
have mods that don't really contribute enough to the tree.

- **Battle for Elements**
	- After speaking with the author, we found that there were several elements
	  in the mod that were incompatible with Cactus, which meant that my port
	  was providing an incomplete gamer experience.
