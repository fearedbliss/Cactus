Credits to the following people for either providing solutions, guidance,
or advice on various aspects for any of my mods (directly or indirectly),
which allowed me to fully succeed with my goals:

- **Blizzard North (and anyone at Blizzard South at the time that helped)** for
  creating Diablo, and Diablo II. None of this would be here if it wasn't for
  your work.
- [**PhrozenKeep**](http://d2mods.info)
- [**GalaXyHaXz**](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution) - Among many things,
  for allowing all Cactus Platforms to no longer require a CD, same as what
  Blizzard did starting with v1.12.
- **Kingpin**
- **Necrolis** - For many things including the FPS Unlock Fix and assistance with
  techniques/code for implementing **`players`** command for 1.00-1.08.
- **Myhrginoc**
- **Lemma**
- **Pharphis**
- **devurandom** - For many things including the FPS Unlock Fix.
- [**CnCNet**](https://github.com/CnCNet/cnc-ddraw) - **`cnc-ddraw`**
- [**libretro**](https://github.com/libretro/glsl-shaders) - Shaders for **`cnc-ddraw`**.
- [**Freepik**](http://www.freepik.com/) - Credits to Freepik from
	[**Flaticon**](https://www.flaticon.com/) for creating the Cactus Icon!
- **ShadowFlare** - For creating WinMPQ, which is used for my MPQ Fixer.
- [**kcat**](https://github.com/kcat/dsoal) - For the 3D Sound / EAX Implementation (**`DSOAL w/ OpenAL Soft`**).
	Thanks to **Manny** for letting me know about 3D Sound & EAX, and Thanks to
	[**ChthonVII**](https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo2/comments/tjdxf1/comment/i1mly2q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
	for letting me know about DSOAL.
- **Volf** - Thank you for all of the backups you've uploaded to PhrozenKeep,
	such as the old versions of PlugY. They are helping me get some more
	complicated mods to be ported over to Cactus.
- **D2SE Community** - Thanks to anyone in the D2SE Community that helped port
	old mods over to D2SE. Sometimes I've used the D2SE port as a stepping for
	the Cactus port.
- **RadTang** - Hopefully you are doing well :).
